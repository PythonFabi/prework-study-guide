# FabiÂ´s Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework-study-guide website is especially designated for bootcamp students who went through the prework, to have their information of the prework-modules in form of notes in one place. I build this website especially to help review the information quickly and not read through all the modules again. I learned a lot on how to use all four tools: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript effectively to create a basic, functional website and connect all tools in one place.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section consists of bullet points that explain each topic: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, briefly and give some basic information to start using them. Open ChromeDevTools with CTRL+SHIFT+I (Windows) or CMD+OPTION+I(MacOS), where a console will appear on the side or bottom of the webpage in the browser.It puts out a list of all the four topics and also gives you a recommendation on what to study first (runs with JavaScript).
