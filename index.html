        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTML</strong>(Hypertext Markup Language) gives the content of the webpage a structure.</li>
          <li>Before the html element we have the declaration <strong>!DOCTYPE html</strong> to show browser type of doc.</li>
          <li>html element can include attribute <strong>lang="en"(english)</strong>, HTML attributes define additional info to element</li>
          <li>The <strong>head</strong> element contains information about the webpage (for the browser).</li>
          <li><strong>title:</strong> browser title bar, <strong>style:</strong> CSS style for webpage, <strong>base:</strong> base url for webpage, <strong>link:</strong> links external resource to webpage</li>
          <li>additional metadata like <strong>meta:</strong>character set, description, keywords, author, viewport etc.</li> 
          <li>e.g.: <strong>charset:</strong> UTF-8 (Unicode 8 defines that all types of characters can be used), <strong>viewport:</strong> lets website adjust to device</li>
          <li><strong>script:</strong> embeds client-side scripts in HTML documents</li>
          <li>The <strong>body</strong> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Both elements are <stong>parent</stong> elements, which have <stong>child</stong> elements nested inside</li>
          <li>elements usually consist out of <strong>opening</strong> and <strong>closing</strong> tags, which have mostly visible content in between them</li>
          <li>Some elements like <strong>br</strong>(line break) or <strong>img</strong>(for images) don`t have a closing tag</li>
          <li>Elements like <strong>img</strong> and <strong>a</strong>(anchor) need attributes like <strong>src</strong>(image source) and <strong>href</strong>(link URL) for the browser to find them</li>
          <li>More attributes like for img: <strong>alt</strong>(description if img doesn`t load and accessibility), <strong>height</strong> and <strong>width</strong>(img size)</li>
          <li>Or <strong>id</strong> to identify elements and select them</li>
          <li><strong>Semantic</strong> HTML elements make webpage accessible for widest variety of users, also those with assistive devices</li>
          <li>Use especially semantic elements with visible content</li>
          <li><strong>headings</strong>(h1(biggest)-h6) and <strong>paragraphs</strong>(p) semantic text elements(use h1 just once and in order to h6 for better accessibility)</li>
          <li><strong>ul, ol, and li</strong> for <strong>unordered list</strong>(bulleted), <strong>ordered list</strong> (numbered) and <strong>list items</strong></li>
          <li>Elements like <strong>div</strong>(creates divisions of webpage) and <strong>span</strong>(create inline division) are non-semantic</li>
          <li>We have three main semantic elements in the body element, which are <strong>header, main and footer</strong></li>
          <li>Those can be divided into <strong>sections</strong></li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading style sheets) gives the content of a webpage style with (colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization) <br />
          and defines style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using wide range of style options</li>
          <li><strong>3</strong> ways to use CSS: <strong>Inline CSS</strong>(use style attribute on specific HTML element), <strong>internal style sheet</strong>(embeds style element in head element
          one change in CSS rule applies to all tagged page elements), <strong>external style sheet</strong>(preferred in most cases, allows developers to work on seperate file)</li>
          <li>external stylesheet will be linked with <strong>link</strong> element and attributes <strong>rel</strong>="stylesheet" (relation between HTML and external CSS sheet) and <br />
          <strong>href</strong>="URL" <strong>(seperation of concerns)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>CSS rules</strong> consist of: <strong>selector</strong>(element to style), and <strong>Declaration block</strong>(in curled braces with unlimited declarations)</li>
          <li><strong>Declarations</strong> consist of two elements: <strong>Property</strong>(e.g. color or text-align) and <strong>Value</strong> (each property holds a value, e.g. blue, center)</li>
          <li><strong>CSS classes and IDs:</strong> identify elements, class allow us to share CSS rule to any chosen element (.class as selector)</li>
          <li>one declaration block can have several selectors, <strong>DRY</strong>(Do not repeat yourself, reuse and share pieces of code)</li>
          <li><strong>text-align:</strong> Right, Center, Left, justify</li>
          <li><strong>font-size, font-color, font-family, font-weight, font-style etc.:</strong> examples 20px, blue, Helvetica, bold, italic</li>
          <li><strong>display:</strong> block (each element start on new line), inline (all elements in the same line)</li>
          <li>A <strong>margin</strong> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A <strong>padding</strong> indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>An element can have a <strong>border</strong> around it, with the size value, with <em>solid</em> it becomes visible and with color you can determine the color </li>
          <li>colors can be either just blue, grey etc. or it can have <strong>Hex-codes</strong> which begin with # and a combination of numbers and letters with 6 characters</li>
          <li>3 primary Hex colors are <strong>Red</strong>(#FF0000), <strong>Green</strong>(#00FF00) and <strong>Blue</strong>(#0000FF)</li>
          <li><strong>CSS Box Model:</strong> every HTML essentially a box, starts with margin outside, border, padding and content of element </li>
          <li><strong>Box-shadow:</strong> x-axis(to the right), y-axis(to the left) and color</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Git</strong> is a version control tool that let`s us revert back to different versions of our code without breaking our main code</li>
          <li><strong>Github</strong> is a cloud-based website that let`s us collaborate with other developers using version control with Git</li>
          <li>A <strong>branch</strong> is a copy or version of code that can be worked on independently in isolation without overwriting our team members code</li>
          <li><strong>main(master) branch</strong> is our default version of code, which can be updated with <strong>feature- or development-branches</strong>, which are copies of default branch</li>
          <li>Those can be <strong>merged</strong> back into the main branch, after change is completed</li>
          <li><strong>git status:</strong> checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li><strong>git checkout -b branch-name:</strong> creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li><strong>git add -A:</strong> adds all modifications in current working directory to the staging area of Git ready for commit</li>
          <li><strong>git commit –m [commit message]:</strong> descriptive commit message in imperative; max 50 characters, should be less; snapshot of currently staged changes</li>
          <li><strong>git pull origin main:</strong> look if local base branch is in sync with Github base branch, make sure to have latest version of project on local computer, not outdated <br />
          (if a team member pushes changes to main branch, we always want to have the <strong>most updated version</strong> in our local branch to prevent sync issues)</li>
          <li><strong>git push origin [branch-name]:</strong> (if feature-branch name: feature/branch-name) push changes from local to remote Git branch</li>
          <li><strong>Visit GitHub website</strong> to compare and create <strong>pull request (PR)</strong>, click green button</li>
          <li>Descriptive PR  title, instructions for team members reviewing on changes made, how feature is supposed to function and how to start app so feature can be tested</li>
          <li>Designate <strong>base branch</strong> as main, and <strong>comparison branch</strong> as local (feature) branch, because local branch will merge into main</li>
          <li><strong>Create PR</strong></li>
          <li>Usually request one or two team members to view PR, after that <strong>“Merge PR”</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Update</strong> local main branch with remote branch with: git pull origin main</li>
          <li>Delete feature-branch after to prevent accidently reusing old branches: <strong>git branch -D [branch-name]</strong></li>
          <li>This is the usual <strong>GitHub workflow</strong></li>
